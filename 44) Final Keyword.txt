If class is declared final then that class can't be inherited and cannot be declared as abstract 
If method is declared final then that method can't be overidden . When we define final method we can't use abstract keyqrod 
If variable is declared final then the java compiler treat it as constant .. We can declare static , local , instant varibale as final */
